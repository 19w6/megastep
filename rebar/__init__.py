"""**rebar** is a library for *reinforcement* . That's why it's called rebar!

Unlike the :mod:`megastep` module which is stable, documented and feature-complete, rebar is an unstable,
undocumented work-in-progress. It's grown organically from my reinforcement learning research, and continues to do
so. It's in the megastep repo because megastep itself uses two of rebar's most useful components:
:class:`rebar.dotdict.dotdict` and :class:`rebar.arrdict.arrdict` , and the demo uses a whole lot more.
