    <!-- Tracking pageviews is really useful to me to see what kind of stuff
    I've done is useful to people. But I'm keen to not to track any more than
    that, and so this is a minimal solution. It's a self-hosted matomo tracking
    pixel with IP anonymization and no-tracking-preference compliance. It gives
    me no more information than the server logs would, if I could actually
    access github-pages' server logs. Your data will not be shared with anyone,
    and I will be the only person to ever look at the stats. -->
