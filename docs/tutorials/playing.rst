Playing With Megastep
=====================
While the :ref:`Minimal Environment <minimal-env>` tutorial is extremely detailed, it's not particularly *fun*. This 
tutorial instead takes an existing interesting environment and tasks you to adapt it in specific ways. In solving
these tasks, you'll learn how megastep is structured while hopefully keeping the problem-solving part of your brain
from losing interest.
